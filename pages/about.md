> CiSE seeks (sought) submissions for this 2024 special issue.

- Submission Deadline: 24 December 2023
- Anticipated Publication: September/October 2024
- Publication November 2024

Major trends have brought the cloud and high-performance-computing (HPC) communities closer together: the maturation of cloud technologies has shifted focus toward running workloads efficiently, and composite scientific workflows and resource heterogeneity and dynamism have revealed the limitations of traditional HPC resource and workflow management. It has become clear that the initially disparate communities have much to benefit in working together. This special issue aims to bridge the gap between HPC and cloud to discuss work in converged computing—the collaborative space between these traditionally separate communities—to develop novel technologies and applications. These hybrid technologies might span the gamut from automation, workflows, containerization, to software development and deployment and testing. This is a timely topic as collaborative work is happening to a greater degree that combines approaches from high-performance-computing with cloud-native computing.

### Background

Published by the IEEE Computer Society, Computing in Science & Engineering magazine features the latest computational science and engineering research in an accessible format, along with departments covering news and analysis, CSE in education, and emerging technologies.

### Submission Guidelines

For author information and guidelines on submission criteria, please visit the CiSE Author Information page. Please submit papers through the ScholarOne system, and be sure to select the special-issue name. Manuscripts should not be published or currently submitted for publication elsewhere. Please submit only full papers intended for review (not abstracts) to the ScholarOne portal.

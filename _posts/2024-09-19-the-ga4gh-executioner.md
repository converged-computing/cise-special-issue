The Global Alliance for Genomics and Health (GA4GH) Task Execution Service (TES) API is a standardized schema and API for describing and executing batch execution tasks. It provides a common way to submit and manage tasks to a variety of compute environments, including on-premises High Performance Compute and High Throughput Computing (HPC/HTC) systems, Cloud computing platforms, and hybrid environments. The TES API is designed to be flexible and extensible, allowing it to be adapted to a wide range of use cases, such as “bringing compute to the data” solutions for federated and distributed data analysis or load balancing across multi-cloud infrastructures. This API has been adopted by a number of different service providers and utilized by several workflow engines, yielding a single abstracted interface for developers and researchers. Using its capabilities, genome research institutes are building extensible hybrid compute systems to study life science.
